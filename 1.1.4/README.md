> Google Cloud APIs are programmatic interfaces to Google Cloud Platform services. They are a key part of Google Cloud Platform, allowing you to easily add the power of everything from computing to networking to storage to machine-learning-based data analysis to your applications.

> Cloud APIs are implemented as network API services, such as Cloud Pub/Sub API. Each Cloud API typically runs on one or more subdomains of googleapis.com, such as pubsub.googleapis.com, and provides both JSON HTTP and gRPC interfaces to clients over public internet and virtual private cloud (VPC) networks. Clients can send HTTP and gRPC requests directly to Cloud API endpoints or by using client libraries.
