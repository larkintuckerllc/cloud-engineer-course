> Google Cloud Marketplace lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud. Even if you are unfamiliar with services like Compute Engine or Cloud Storage, you can start up a familiar software package without having to manually configure the software, virtual machine (VM) instances, storage, or network settings. You can deploy a software package now, and scale that deployment later when your apps require additional capacity.

> Many software packages in Cloud Marketplace are free to use, and you only pay the standard usage fees for the Google Cloud resources that you run the software on.

> If you buy commercial software from Cloud Marketplace, such as a virtual machine (VM) with software installed, a Kubernetes app, or a software as a service (SaaS) product, you are charged for the software and for the Google Cloud resources that you use. The software usage fees appear as a separate item on your monthly Google Cloud invoice.

> You can use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to create a set of Google Cloud resources and manage them as a unit, called a deployment. For example, if your team's development environment needs two virtual machines (VMs) and a BigQuery database, you can define these resources in a configuration file, and use Deployment Manager to create, change, or delete these resources. You can make the configuration file part of your team's code repository, so that anyone can create the same environment with consistent results.
